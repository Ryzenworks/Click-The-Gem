🎮 Find the Gem — Java Game
Find the Gem is a beginner-friendly desktop game developed using Java Swing and AWT, inspired by the popular Whac-A-Mole game. The objective is simple: click on gems to score points while avoiding skulls — clicking a skull ends the game.

This project was created to improve my understanding of GUI programming, event handling, and image rendering in Java. It serves as a casual reflex-based game and a great learning project for anyone exploring Java desktop applications.
