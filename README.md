# Click-The-Gem
Find the Gem is a simple Java Swing game inspired by Whac-A-Mole. Click gems to score points while avoiding skulls that end the game. It uses buttons, timers, and ImageIcon for images. This project helped me improve Java GUI skills, event handling, and dynamic interface updates with a minimal design focused on responsiveness.
